	Secure files look like this after using "ls -l" cmd:

	zoo:primates> ls -l
	-rw-r--r-- keeper prim 547 9:31 chimps
	-rw-r--r-- keeper prim 983 9:32 gorillas
	-rw-r--r-- keeper prim 485 9:34 sq_monks

	For "chmod" to add permissions it would be "+" to remove permissions it would
	be "-"
	
	Syntax = chmod ('u','g',and/or'o') +/- ('r','w',and/or'x')
	example = chmod u+rwx OR chmod ugo-rwx OR chmod ugo+rwx
