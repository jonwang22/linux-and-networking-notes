DNS- Domain Name System:
-Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

1. A domain name is entered into a web browser.
2. The browser asks the ISP's DNS server to resolve the request.
3. If the ISP's DNS can't resolve the domain name it asks a root server.
4. If the root server does not know it will ask another name server that knows about ".com" domains.
5. The server answers the request with the IP address. ---it is marked as authoritative
6. The ISP's DNS responds to the web browser with the IP address.
7. The query is then cached for ... 24 hours?
13 root servers are run by ICANN-> US company





DHCP- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
-Automatically assigns IP configurations to hosts on a network.

DHCPDISCOVER->DHCPOFFER->DHCPREQUEST->DHCPACK
Initializing-> Selecting-> Requesting-> Binding-> Renewing->Rebinding
1. A client issues a DHCP DISCOVER msg via a Broadcast.(255.255.255.255)
2. The DHCP server receives the msg, and replies with a DHCP OFFER as a broadcast... msg w/the clients MAC.
3. Once the client receives the DHCP OFFER, it sends a DHCP REQUEST msg to the server which accepts the network configuration.
4. The DHCP server sends a DHCP ACK msg to acknowledge the DHCP REQUEST.
5. The client then uses the network configuration and is on the network.




ARP- Address Resolution Protocol
-Determines the MAC address of a host when only the IP addresses is known.
